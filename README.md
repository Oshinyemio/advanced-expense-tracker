# üíé Advanced Expense Tracker

A multi-user, serverless expense tracker built using AWS services. Users can sign up, sign in, and manage personal expenses with receipt uploads and analytics dashboards. This project extends the foundational serverless architecture by adding authentication, S3 storage, CloudFront delivery, and QuickSight insights.

## üöÄ Features

- Built using AWS services within the Free Tier (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB).  
- Lambda functions add, retrieve, and export expense data per user.  
- Secure multi-user authentication via Amazon Cognito.  
- Receipt image upload and storage in an S3 bucket.  
- Hosted frontend assets on CloudFront for low-latency global delivery.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Infrastructure

- The `infrastructure/ExpenseTracker_API-prod-oas30.yaml` file contains the exported OpenAPI (YAML) configuration for API Gateway. Import this into any AWS account/region to recreate the same endpoints.  
- Amazon Cognito User Pool and App Client handle sign-up, sign-in, and JWT issuance.  
- An S3 bucket (e.g., `expense-tracker-data-ope`) stores JSON expense files and uploaded receipt images.  
- CloudFront distribution serves static frontend assets from S3 with HTTPS and caching.

## üöÄ How to Run & Deploy

### üñ•Ô∏è Local Testing

1. Open `frontend/login.html` in a modern browser.  
2. Sign up or sign in using an existing Cognito user.  
3. Upon successful login, you will be redirected to `tracker.html`.  
4. On `tracker.html`, enter **User ID**, **Amount**, **Category**, and **Description**, then click **Add Expense**.  
5. Click **View My Expenses** to fetch all items for the provided user ID.

> **Note:** For local testing without AWS resources, some buttons will not work. You can still confirm UI layout and form validation.

### üõ†Ô∏è Deploy Backend

## Backend Deployment Instructions (Updated)

### 1. Create DynamoDB Table

* Table name: `Expenses`
* Partition key: `userId` (String)
* Sort key: `timestamp` (String)

### 2. Deploy Lambda Functions

* Create `AddExpenseFunction` (Python 3.x) to handle POST requests
* Create `GetExpenseFunction` (Python 3.x) to handle GET requests
* Create `ExportExpenseFunction` (Python 3.x) to export expense data to S3
* All function code is located in the `backend/` folder

### 3. IAM Role

* Create a role named `Full_DynamoDB_S3_Access`
* Attach managed policies: `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess` and `AmazonS3FullAccess`
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This approach does not follow least privilege but simplifies setup for demo purposes

### 4. Set Up Amazon Cognito

* Create a User Pool and configure required attributes (e.g., email)
* Create an App Client (no client secret) and note the User Pool ID and App Client ID
* In Lambda functions, extract `userId` from the JWT token provided by Cognito
* 
### 5. Configure API Gateway

* Create a new REST API
* Import the OpenAPI spec from `infrastructure/ExpenseTracker_API-prod-oas30.yaml`
* Enable CORS for `POST /expenses`, `GET /expenses`, and `GET /export-expenses`
* Set Authorization to use Cognito User Pool Authorizer with Token Source: `Authorization`
* Configure stage-level throttling (e.g., 100 RPS, 200 burst)
* Deploy the API to a stage (e.g., `prod`) and note the Invoke URL

### 6. Create S3 Buckets

* Create `user-expense-tracker-data` for storing JSON expense data; no public access
* Grant permissions for Lambda to put objects and QuickSight to read objects
* Create `user-expense-tracker-frontend` for hosting static files (`login.html` and `tracker.html`); enable public read access
* (Optional) Enable versioning on `user-expense-tracker-frontend` to retain previous HTML versions

### 7. Set Up CloudFront

* Create a CloudFront distribution pointing to the `user-expense-tracker-frontend` S3 bucket
* Use the static website hosting endpoint or an Origin Access Identity (OAI)
* Configure HTTP to redirect to HTTPS
* Allow public access (no WAF)
* Restrict geo-location to North America and Europe to stay within the free tier

### 8. Configure QuickSight (Optional)

* Create a new QuickSight dataset using S3 as the source
* Point to the `user-expense-tracker-data` bucket or a specific prefix
* Build dashboards to visualize spending trends, category breakdowns, and exports

---

## üí° Host Frontend

1. Upload `login.html` and `tracker.html` to your S3 bucket under a folder (e.g., `public/`).  
2. If using CloudFront, set the bucket‚Äôs **static website hosting** or configure an Origin Path to serve these HTML files.  
3. Ensure CORS settings on S3 allow your API‚Äôs domain to be called from these pages.  
4. Update the JavaScript in both HTML files to point `fetch` calls to your API Gateway Invoke URL.
